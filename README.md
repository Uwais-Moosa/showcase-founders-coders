# Uwais' Personal Showcase Website

## Introduction

Hi there! My name is Uwais and I'm excited to present my personal showcase website. This website serves as my introduction to the world as an aspiring web developer. I'm building it from scratch, using nothing but HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, all hosted via GitHub Pages. I decided to challenge myself by giving the website a retro style
and adding multiple boxes, as a way to show my commitment to challenges.

## Project Goals

In creating this website, my goals are to:

1.  Introduce myself, sharing both my personal and professional journey.
2.  Discuss my ambitions and motivations for transitioning into web development.
3.  Showcase my current skills and what I've learned so far in the field of web development.
4.  Create an aesthetically pleasing and interactive layout solely using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
5.  Host this website on GitHub Pages and provide a link back to my GitHub repository.

## Encountered Challenges

My journey to build this website was filled with interesting challenges. Here are a few of them:

-   **Design and Layout**: Figuring out an engaging and effective layout took considerable time. 
-   **Responsiveness**: Ensuring that the website looked good and functioned well on all types of devices was challenging, especially considering the variety of screen sizes out there today.
-   **JavaScript Application**: As a beginner, it was tricky to implement JavaScript to achieve the desired interactivity and functionality.
-   **Hosting on GitHub Pages**:  Learning to navigate GitHub and understanding the hosting process was a bit of a challenge.

## More About the Website

My website includes sections about myself, why I am applying to Founders & Coders, the reasons behind choosing this project, and my journey into tech. It provides detailed insights into my aspirations, background, and achievements.

I used a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build different components of the website. The JavaScript in my website was used to enhance user experience, adding a level of interactivity to the text content. Each word within specific tags becomes its own span, allowing for more granular control of animations or effects.

To showcase my commitment to this journey and this application, I decided to take a risk. I ventured into new territories of design and layout that required me to rely heavily on online research. But the result, I believe, is a website that not only introduces me to the world as a web developer but also stands as a testament to my growth, resilience, and dedication.

## Final Words

This project was not just a test of my current knowledgeâ€”it was a platform for me to learn, experiment, and grow as a developer. Each challenge I faced, each problem I solved, was a step forward on my journey. I hope that my website resonates with you, and I invite you to join me as I continue this exciting adventure into web development!
