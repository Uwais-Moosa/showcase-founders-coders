								Hello,
								<br />
								I'm Uwais

							<div class="header-text">
							<p>
							I am a Londoner currently working for the Department for Work and
							Pensions. My background is in Law, a field I chose out of a deep
							sense of ethics and desire to help others. After university
							I started working in Property management. After deciding to improve
							my life, and to extract myself from an environment that didn't
							match my values (the property world), I decided to seek for a
							career that would bring purpose to my life. The COVID-19 crisis
							shed light on the crucial role of technology in our lives,
							inspiring me to pivot towards web development. I now aim to blend
							my passion for problem-solving with the power of digital tools to
							make a meaningful impact.

					<div class="about-content">
						<p>
							My interest in coding and technology is rooted in its potential to
							change the world. The ability to write code and build software
							allows us to solve complex problems, innovate, and even reimagine
							our societies. It's this transformative potential that I find
							profoundly captivating. Through my personal explorations in tech,
							I have come to appreciate the importance of collaboration,
							continuous learning, and contributing to open source. This
							understanding resonates perfectly with Founders and Coders'
							philosophy of peer-led learning and its community-driven approach.
							I am particularly excited about the opportunity to learn from and
							with my peers, a model I believe will cultivate a strong
							foundation in coding and collaborative problem solving. I see
							Founders and Coders as the perfect platform to accelerate my
							growth as a developer. The program's emphasis on real-world,
							project-based learning aligns with my learning style. I thrive on
							practical application and the tangible solving of problems.
							Lastly, I'm excited by the idea of giving back. The ethos of the
							Founders and Coders community, where graduates contribute to the
							learning of new students, is a culture I'm eager to be part of. As
							much as I am excited to learn, I'm equally eager to contribute to
							the collective knowledge and success of the community.

							I anticipated other applicants (hopefully future classmates and colleagues) 
							might opt for impressive designs or a gamified approach for the showcase website. 
							Recognising the challenge of creating something truly unique, 
							I resolved to demonstrate my commitment by drawing extensively from the learning 
							resources you've provided, as well as by learning from the requirements
							you provided for other projects on your platform, 
							such as The Movie App, the Gallery Project, the Hobby Page, the Website, and the Game.
							My website design, incorporating multiple boxes and section borders, reflects 
							my willingness to tackle complex tasks and learn. 
							While my vision was clear, my skills were initially lacking, so I relied heavily 
							on online research to create my website.

					<div class="learning-content">
						<p>
							I'm a firm believer in lifelong learning, and this belief has
							guided me as I navigate my transition into web development. Here's
							a quick overview of the key steps in my journey so far:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								üìñ <strong>Books:</strong> To get a solid grasp of the basics, I
								delved into HTML & CSS and JavaScript & jQuery, both by Jon
								Duckett. These books have been instrumental in building a strong
								foundation.
							</li>
							<li>
								üíª <strong>Online Courses:</strong> I've been leveraging online
								platforms for structured learning. Codecademy has been my
								primary guide, supplemented by Colt Steele's comprehensive web
								development course. These resources have allowed me to put my
								learning into practice.
							</li>
							<li>
								üë• <strong>Mentorship and Networking:</strong> Recognising the
								value of community and guidance, I attended the Muslamic Makers
								fest. There, I sought a mentor who could offer me personalised
								advice and support on my journey. These interactions have given
								me fresh perspectives and invaluable advice.
							</li>
							<li>
								üó£Ô∏è <strong>Public Speaking:</strong> Anticipating the
								collaborative nature of tech roles, I've been proactively
								improving my public speaking skills. I've taken on new tasks and
								trainings at work, pushing myself out of my comfort zone and
								preparing me for future presentations and team collaborations.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, but I know
							that every step is bringing me closer to my goal of becoming a
							software engineer. The joy I find in problem-solving and the drive
							to make a positive impact through tech fuel me to continue
							learning and growing. I'm excited to see where this journey will
							lead!
